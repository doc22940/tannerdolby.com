Hi there! My name is Tanner Dolby. I'm a mathematician and front-end developer based in Sacramento, CA. I enjoy using semantic and accessible HTML paired with modern CSS to build fast websites.

I started my journey as a self taught developer on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) in 2017. Ever since then, I've been hooked on building things for the web. I also enjoy creating fun CSS illustrations and front-end demos on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tannerdolby) in my free time. 

With the JAMstack movement on the rise, I've recently taken an interest in Static Site Generators (SSG). In particular [11ty](https://11ty.dev), which this website is built with.

## Education
I recieved my Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics from Arizona State University on May 11, 2020. Due to a [global pandemic](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), the university didn't conduct an in-person commencement ceremenony. Feel free to take a look at the [virtual ceremonies](https://vgradasu.z4.web.core.windows.net/asu/III/#811351). 

During my time at ASU, I worked as an Undergraduate Researcher and Supplemental Instruction leader for Differential Equations. My passion for mathematics and computing became most apparent to me after completing discrete math and linear algebra. At the moment, I don't have plans for attending grad school but I'm interested in learning about [Knot Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics)).
