My name is Tanner Dolby. I'm a mathematician and front-end developer based in Sacramento, CA. I enjoy using semantic and accessible HTML paired with modern CSS to build fast websites. I'm currently focused on learning more about Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and SVG.

I enjoy creating fun CSS illustrations and front-end demos on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tannerdolby) in my free time. With the JAMstack movement on the rise, I've recently taken an interest in Static Site Generators (SSG). In particular [11ty](https://11ty.dev), which this website is currently powered by.

## Education
I recieved my Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Mathematics from Arizona State University on May 11, 2020. Due to the global pandemic, COVID-19. ASU didn't conduct in-person commencement ceremenonies. Feel free to take a look at the [virtual ceremonies](https://vgradasu.z4.web.core.windows.net/asu/III/#811351) ASU hosted. 

During my time at ASU, I worked as an Undergraduate Researcher and Supplemental Instruction leader for Differential Equations. My passion for mathematics became most apparent to me after taking Differential Equations and Linear Algebra. I'm interested in learning more about the field of topology and specifically, [Knot Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics)).

I started my journey as a self taught developer using [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) in 2017. Ever since then, I've been hooked on building things for the web.
