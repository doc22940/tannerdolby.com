I like to write about technology and web development. I'm currently fixated on learning more about accessibility guidelines and web performance. If you'd like to see me write about a specific topic or concept, feel free to message me about it. Lately, I've been very interested in CSS illustrations and SVG. I may write about these hobbies in future posts.
