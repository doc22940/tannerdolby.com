I enjoy creating illustrations and other fun things with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It all started when I read [this article](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/09/single-div-drawings-with-css/) on Mozilla Hacks about single div drawings. I was instantly hooked after witnessing the power of a single container element combined with box-shadows and gradients to create realistic objects. 

My more recent drawings have strayed away from this method and into an odd `div` soup paired with CSS to create SVG-like illustrations.
